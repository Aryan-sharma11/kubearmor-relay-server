# KubeArmor Relay Server

KubeArmor's relay server collects all messages, alerts, and system logs generated by KubeArmor in each node, and then it allows other logging systems to simply collect those through the service ('kubearmor.kube-system.svc') of the relay server.

By default, the relay server is deployed with KubeArmor.
